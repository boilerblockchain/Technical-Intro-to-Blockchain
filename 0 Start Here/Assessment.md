## Section 1 - JavaScript Basics ##
First let's review the basics of Javascript and Typescript, the languages we will be using throught the course to develop our Web Applications :)

JavaScript (Js) is a the main scripting programming language for Web pages, originally it was used as the client side in front end development. It can also be used in non-browser environments such as Node.js enabling a wide range of new uses:
- Web Applications, Mobile Apps, Networking Apps, Games etc
Some common uses: detecting a user's browser, storing browsing cookies, form input validation etc

A scripting language is a high-level programming language that is interpreted by another program at runtime rather than compiled by the computer, other popular scripting languages are PHP and Python. Js is often used together with HTML/CSS, Java or C++.

Typescript (Ts) is an Object-oriented programming language that is complied, not interpreted. It is Js with some extra features, supporting all Js libraries! It has some advantages over Ts:
- Create both client-side and server-side 
- Detect errors at compile-time, get less runtime errors
- Static typing support, check type correctness at compile time


Converting code between languages
Ts to Js: Ts code is not direcly supported by broswers, thus it has to Trans-piled to be read directly in your console.
Js to Ts: simply change the file extension from .js to .ts
